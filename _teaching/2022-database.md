Database Management
======
125 hours of courses in database science and management were given during my PhD. 
The courses were given to master's students. 
The requirements were database design based on real business problems, 
and the use of python and SQL to create and use the database.

Web Development
======
The lessons learned in the database management course were then taken further in a Web programming project. 
The aim of the student project was to design a complete ERP in python / html / CSS using the Flask library. 
150H of project time were given over the 3 years of the PhD.
