My life began 25 years ago in Montpellier (South of France). 
Since then I've been doing science and that's why I'm now looking for a Postdoc for January 2025. 
I'm currently doing a PhD at the Arts et MÃ©tiers Institute of Technology, working on the automatic generation of CAD assemblies. 
I'm passionate about hiking and nature sports, I read a lot of comics, and I'm always up for a drink.

What I am looking for
======

I'd like to become a lecturer in computer-aided design in the long term. I love teaching students, and academic research allows me to constantly push the boundaries of knowledge so that I can pass on more and more knowledge to those who want to learn. At the end of my PhD, I'd like to do a postdoc in a foreign country. I continued my PhD 150km from where I was born, so I'm looking for adventure in a slightly different culture! I'm passionate about all projects involving artificial intelligence applied to design. Particularly when AI is used to solve design aid problems, whether for direct design or reverse engineering. 

What I am doing now
======

I'm doing a thesis on automatic generation of CAD assemblies. Automatic CAD model generation topics have often been explored, but assembly generation topics are much rarer. This very simple subject raises a lot of questions, and multiple sub-problems have been tackled so far. The issues addressed are very different:
- automatic detection of CAD constraints 
- modification of dead models
- collision-free kinematic resolution of an assembly
- interface-based part search
- automatic semantic classification of parts
- automatic constraint search....  
I really like my PhD topic and this is why I wouuld like to continue to do research in theses topics.

What I like
======

I often go bivouacking in the mountains with my girlfriend to breathe fresh air in the French Alps. 
I read and draw a lot of comics and manga. 
I was a top-level kitesurfer for a long time, so I like to get out on the water. 
And if not, I'm starting to sew and I really like doing it, but I miss having friends to chat with when I'm sewing. 
In my spare time I also play classical piano and go climbing.
